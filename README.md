coding challange

<p>
  I was looking for new challenges and came across various sites and repositories on the internet where developers were starting or had started a 365 day coding challenge.
</p>
<p>
  However, I noticed that unfortunately very few actually followed through with this until the end.
</p>
<p>
  That's why I decided on an alternative path: the 52 week coding challenge. This offers more flexibility. I am free to decide on which day I want to take on the challenge. I may also choose to complete the project over several days.
</p>
<p>
  First I need to evaluate which projects can be completed within a few days. Maybe it makes more sense to implement 1 huge project over 52 weeks? Or alternately: sometimes 1 related project over a few weeks and smaller ones over 1 or several days? Therefore, this repository with all its projects and branches will probably only be publicly accessible afterwards. We will see ...

  May the challenge-force be with me ^^.
